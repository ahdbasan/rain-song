 "The Rainbow Song"

Look up high, what do you see?
A rainbow shining, wild and free! ðŸŒˆ
Red like apples, juicy and bright,
Orange like sunsets glowing at night.

Yellow like the sun, so warm in the sky,
Green like the grass where butterflies fly. ðŸ¦‹
Blue like the ocean, calm and deep,
Indigo dreams when you're asleep. ðŸŒŒ
indigooo

Violet whispers, soft and small,
Colors of love, we see them all!
Rainbows sparkle, rainbows play,
A magical promise after the gray.

o little one, let your colors show,
Shine like a rainbow wherever you go! ðŸŒŸ
