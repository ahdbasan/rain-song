 "The Rainbow Song"

Look up high, what do you see?
A rainbow shining, wild and free! ğŸŒˆ
Red like apples, juicy and bright,
Orange like sunsets glowing at night.

Yellow like the sun, so warm in the sky,
Green like the grass where butterflies fly. ğŸ¦‹
Blue like the ocean, calm and deep,
Indigo dreams when you're asleep. ğŸŒŒ
